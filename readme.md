## Trust-region optimization

This is a handbook level implementation of trust-region optimization algorithm based on Dogeleg and Cauchy methods.

### Results
Below, the results for running the algorithm based on two methods are illustrated.

The function to optimize is (1 − 𝑥)^2 + 10(𝑦 − 𝑥2)^2 .
